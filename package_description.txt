JTDX  is a  computer  program  designed  to  facilitate basic  amateur
radio communication using very weak signals.
.
JTDX  Version  2.0 offers six different  protocols or modes: FT4, FT8,
JT9, JT65, T10 and WSPR.
.
WSPR (pronounced  `whisper`) stands for (W)eak  (S)ignal (P)ropagation
(R)eporter.   The WSPR  protocol  was designed  for probing  potential
propagation  paths  using   low-power  transmissions.   WSPR  messages
normally carry the transmitting  stationâ€™s callsign, grid locator, and
transmitter power in  dBm, and they can be  decoded at signal-to-noise
ratios as  low as  -28 dB  in a  2500 Hz  bandwidth.  WSPR  users with
internet  access  can  automatically  upload reception  reports  to  a
central  database called  wsprnet  that provides  a mapping  facility,
archival storage,  and many other  features. WSPR has a  new companion
FST4W which has  a similar message content but offers  up to 30 minute
transmission periods for greater sensitivity on LF and MF.
.
JTDXX  provides spectral displays for  receiver passbands as wide as 5
kHz,  flexible  rig control  for  nearly  all  modern radios  used  by
amateurs, and a wide variety of special aids such as automatic Doppler
tracking for EME QSOs and Echo testing.  The program runs equally well
on Windows,  Macintosh, and  Linux systems, and  installation packages
are available for all three platforms.
